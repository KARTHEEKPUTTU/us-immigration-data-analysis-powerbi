# US Immigration Data Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes long-term trends in U.S. immigration using historical data. The analysis focuses on lawful permanent residents, refugee arrivals, and noncitizen enforcement actions to understand how immigration patterns and enforcement activities have evolved over time.

The project presents insights through interactive Power BI dashboards designed for non-technical stakeholders.

## Objective
- Analyze trends in lawful permanent residents and refugee arrivals over time  
- Examine noncitizen enforcement metrics including apprehensions, removals, and returns  
- Identify long-term patterns and fluctuations across immigration categories  
- Communicate insights clearly through visual dashboards

## Key Insights
- Lawful permanent residency shows relatively stable long-term trends compared to refugee arrivals.
- Refugee arrivals fluctuate more sharply, reflecting sensitivity to humanitarian policies and global events.
- Noncitizen apprehensions and returns follow similar up-and-down patterns, particularly during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
- In recent years, apprehensions have increased sharply without a similar rise in removals or returns, suggesting a growing enforcement gap.
